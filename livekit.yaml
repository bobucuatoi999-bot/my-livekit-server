# LiveKit Server Configuration for Railway Deployment
# This config is optimized for Railway's TCP Proxy feature (UDP is blocked)

# RTC Configuration for TCP-only mode (Railway blocks UDP)
rtc:
  # Use the SAME port as main port - Railway limitation

  port_range_end: 60000

# Redis configuration
# Will be overridden by LIVEKIT_REDIS_ADDRESS environment variable

# Explicitly disable TURN server
# Railway TCP proxy handles media routing, TURN not needed
# Disabling prevents TLS certificate errors
